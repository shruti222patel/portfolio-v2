            <h3>Jersey City Council</h3>
            <br>
            <p>The Black Lives Matter movement opened my eyes to the injustices perpetrated by our government toward its constituents and the role I played with my complacency and ignorance. So, I started participating in city council meetings and offering my tech skills to government officials pushing for change. I worked with councilpersons to project the amount of money the city would save by decreasing police new-hires based on a few tunable parameters such as the number of retirees, rate of promotions, and others. The police salary calculator project has ended, and I am now pursuing other projects with government officials.</p>
