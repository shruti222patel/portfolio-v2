            <h3>Monarch Butterfly Migration</h3>  
            
            <br/>
            
            <p>Every year hundreds of millions of monarch butterflies fly 3,000 miles from Canada, through America, to their winter home in Mexico. In the last two decades, the migratory monarch butterfly population dropped 80%. Consequently, the US government is now considering designating the monarch butterfly as an endangered species.</p>
        
            <p>I am a part of an inter-disciplinary team, including an ecologist from Emory, and ML researchers from Vanderbilt and Stanford, using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to help conservationists save the butterflies.</p>

            <p>Our deep learning model takes images of dense butterfly clusters and predicts the number of butterflies in the image with a 93% accuracy. The model accomplishes this by reading in the butterfly cluster image, transforming the data, and outputting a corresponding density map, the integral of which provides the count of the butterflies in the image.</p>

            <p>I will post a link to the research paper once we post it on bioarxiv.</p>
