            <h3>Emergency Medical Services (EMS)</h3>                
            <br/>
            <p>People always ask me, “Why do EMS?” They cannot fathom why I would want to work for free in a stressful, life-or-death environment when I already have an intellectually fulfilling job. What they don’t know is EMS fills the gaps in my life left by programming.</p>            
            <p>One of the many reasons I gravitate towards programming is I can help many many people simultaneously with my work as programming makes it easy to solve problems at scale. However, when solving problems with programming, I don’t have a human connection with the people I help. I can’t tangibly see how my code helps them.</p>
            <p>I can’t see the joy on a frail grandma’s face when she sees me and my EMT partner walk into the door after she’s just had a stroke and now knows she has capable help.</p>
            <p>I can’t see the relief on a panicked, middle-aged woman with congestive heart failure after I cajole, coax, and hold her hand her through wearing a CPAP mask, a life saving treat that at first feels like suffocation.</p>
            <p>So, although I know I am leaving this world in a slightly better state than I found it through programming, it is EMS that shows me I am.</p>
