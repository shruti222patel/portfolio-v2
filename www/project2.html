            <p>One of the joys of sisterhood is being corralled into helping plan one’s sister’s wedding. That is the unenviable position I found myself in 2019. My sister was marrying her Prince Charming and I was in charge of heralding it to the world via invites. Thankfully I had a lot of help sending out the invites, however consolidating the RSVPs was another matter. Especially since there were 600 guests attending 3 different events.</p>

            <p>That is when I created RSVPer.</p>

            <p>RSVPer is an SMS based chatbot that uses natural language processing (NLP) to read and respond to RSVP responses from invitees without any human intervention.</p>

            <p>Currently, RSVPer is in closed beta-testing. Please contact me if you would like to participate.</p>
